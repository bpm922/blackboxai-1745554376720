  "content": "satellite imagery captured on april 23, 2025, shows the indian navys indigenous aircraft carrier, ins vikrant, underway in the arabian sea off the coast of karwar, karnataka. this deployment, reported widely on x and defense forums, underscores indias growing naval prowess at a time of heightened tensions with pakistan following the april 2025 pahalgam terror attack. with pakistan suspending the shimla agreement, threatening to withdraw from the tashkent agreement, and mobilizing international pressure over indias suspension of the indus waters treaty iwt, the vikrants presence near pakistans maritime frontier signals indias readiness to assert dominance in the region. as india shifts its strategic focus to the international border ib opposite pakistans punjab, the carriers operations could play a pivotal role in shaping the escalating crisis. the imagery of vikrant underway comes at a critical juncture. the pahalgam attack, linked to pakistan-based the resistance front trf, prompted india to suspend the iwt, downgrade diplomatic ties, and close the attari-wagah border. pakistans responsesuspending the shimla agreement and labeling the iwt suspension an act of warhas raised the specter of conflict. pakistan is also reportedly considering withdrawing from the tashkent agreement, a symbolic move to reject historical peace commitments. pakistans military vulnerabilities add to the stakes. satellite imagery from karachi in march 2025 revealed only two of five pakistan navy submarines operational, with three undergoing prolonged maintenance or stranded on land. the pakistan air force paf relies heavily on its four saab 2000 erieye awacs, vulnerable to indias s-400 missiles. meanwhile, indias strategic shift toward the ib opposite pakistans punjab province, where artillery barrages could target the punjab-dominated military elite, aims to exploit these weaknesses. the vikrants deployment in the arabian sea, just 600700 km from karachi, amplifies this pressure, signaling indias ability to dominate pakistans maritime approaches. vikrants cbg, potentially including destroyers, frigates, and submarines, can enforce a blockade of pakistans key portskarachi and gwadardisrupting trade and energy supplies. posts on x suggest that targeting port infrastructure, such as cranes, could cripple pakistans logistics for years, amplifying the economic impact of a naval blockade. the carriers mig-29k jets, with a combat radius of 850 km, can strike targets deep in pakistan, including paf airbases like masroor karachi and sargodha. this capability complements the indian air forces iaf plans to target paf awacs with s-400 missiles, ensuring air superiority in a potential conflict. the vikrants presence near pakistans coast, coupled with indias artillery focus on the punjab border, could unnerve pakistans military elite. punjab, the heart of pakistans political and military power, is highly sensitive to threats, and a combined land-naval offensive could fracture the pakistan armys cohesion. the imagery, shared by x user detresfa_, suggests vikrant was operating without visible surface escorts, prompting speculation about the presence of a submerged kalvari-class submarine or escorts positioned 10100 km away, as is standard for cbg operations. the carriers elm-2248 mf-star radar and barak-8 missile systems, fitted during its 2024 refit, enhance its self-defense capabilities, reducing reliance on escorts in low-threat scenarios. however, the lack of visible escorts raises concerns about vulnerabilities to pakistans agosta-90b submarines, which can launch babur-3 cruise missiles. pakistans navy, crippled by its submarine shortage, is ill-equipped to counter vikrants cbg. its surface fleet, including four chinese-built type 054ap frigates and milgem-class corvettes, lacks the firepower to challenge indias kolkata-class destroyers or kalvari-class submarines. pakistans reliance on chinese-supplied hangor-class submarines, with deliveries expected only by 2028, leaves it vulnerable in the interim. a blockade by vikrants cbg could choke pakistans economy, which depends on karachi for 60 of its trade. commissioned on september 2, 2022, ins vikrant is indias first indigenously built aircraft carrier, designed by the indian navys warship design bureau and constructed by cochin shipyard limited csl in kochi. the 262-meter-long, 43,000-tonne carrier, with 76 indigenous content, is a symbol of indias self-reliance under the aatmanirbhar bharat initiative. equipped with a short take-off but arrested recovery stobar system, featuring a ski-jump and arrester wires, vikrant can operate up to 30 aircraft, including mig-29k fighter jets, kamov-31 early-warning helicopters, mh-60r multi-role helicopters, and indigenous advanced light helicopters alh. its air wing, recently bolstered by the integration of deck-based mig-29ks, enhances its capability to project power deep into the arabian sea. based at ins kadamba in karwar, vikrant joined the western naval commands fleet in august 2024, alongside the russian-built ins vikramaditya, forming a formidable twin-carrier force. the carriers recent multi-domain exercise in the arabian sea, which included kolkata-class destroyers, talwar-class frigates, and kalvari-class submarines, demonstrated its role as the centerpiece of a carrier battle group cbg. on november 7, 2024, president droupadi murmu embarked on vikrant off goa, witnessing missile drills, submarine maneuvers, and mig-29k operations, affirming its full operational status. note afi is a proud outsourced content creator partner of idrw.org. all content created by afi is the sole property of afi and is protected by copyright. afi takes copyright
