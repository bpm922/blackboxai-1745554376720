  "content": "source raunak kunde  news beat  idrw.org indias light combat helicopter lch, the hal prachand, is poised for a significant enhancement in its offensive capabilities. a collaborative effort between tridentech engineering, iit madras, bharat electronics limited bel, reliance aerospace limited ral, and bilva technologies has resulted in the indigenous development of an 80mm unguided rocket. this new weapon system is slated to arm the prachand, replacing the existing 70mm calibre fz275 lgr laser guided rocket developed by thales, a global leader in aerospace technology. the 80mm rocket will come equipped with various warheads, making it a highly adaptable weapon for the prachand. these include high-explosive anti-tank fragmentation heat-frag for armoured targets, anti-runway warheads for disrupting enemy airfields, thermobaric warheads for enhanced blast effects, and illumination rounds for battlefield support. this versatility ensures the helicopter can address various threats, from enemy fortifications to armoured vehicles and infrastructure. in terms of range, the indigenous 80mm rocket offers a notable improvement over the 70mm fz275 lgr. while the imported thales rocket has an effective range of approximately 7 kilometres, the new 80mm system is designed to achieve a range of 10-12 kilometres. this extension enhances the prachands stand-off capability, allowing it to engage targets from a safer distance and increasing its survivability in contested environments. the replacement of the 70mm fz275 lgr with the 80mm unguided rocket reflects indias growing emphasis on reducing dependence on foreign defence suppliers. the fz275 lgr, while a sophisticated laser-guided system, will now give way to a homegrown alternative that not only meets operational requirements but also aligns with the nations make in india initiative. the development of a laser-guided version of the 80mm rocket in the future will further bridge the gap with advanced imported systems, offering precision strike capabilities alongside the unguided variants cost-effective firepower. note article cannot be reproduced without written permission of idrw.org in any form even for youtube videos to avoid copy right strikes. websites doing illegal reproductions will get dmca and legal notices.",
