  "content": "source raunak kunde  news beat  idrw.org saab aeronautics has positioned its gripen-e fighter jet as a frontrunner in the indian air forces iaf multi-role fighter aircraft mrfa tender for 114 advanced jets by highlighting its adaptability and compatibility with indian-made weapons, including the astra beyond visual range air-to-air missile bvraam series. per-olof marklund, director and head of technology and innovation at saab aeronautics, emphasized the gripen-es flexible and open avionics architecture, which enables rapid integration of weapons and systems, sometimes in just hours. this capability, driven by the jets unique split avionics architecture, offers india a versatile platform tailored to its self-reliance goals under the aatmanirbhar bharat initiative. equipped with the leonardo raven es-05 active electronically scanned array aesa radar, skyward-g infrared search and track irst, and an electronic warfare suite, the gripen-e provides 360-degree situational awareness and robust countermeasures against threats like stealth aircraft. with a 93 mission-capable rate, the gripen-e ensures high sortie rates, critical for the iafs operational tempo against regional threats from china and pakistan. saabs offer includes 100 transfer of technology tot, local production in partnership with the adani group, and source-code sharing, aligning with indias goal of building a domestic aerospace ecosystem. per-olof marklund, speaking at a recent defense seminar covered by idrw.org, underscored the gripen-es split avionics architecture as a game-changer for weapon integration. unlike traditional fighters, where avionics are tightly coupled, the gripen-e separates mission-critical systems e.g., flight control from mission-specific systems e.g., weapons and sensors. this modular design, supported by an open architecture, allows rapid integration of new weapons and avionics without extensive software rewrites. the gripen-es mission system software mss uses standardized interfaces, allowing plug-and-play integration of weapons and sensors. updates can be rolled out during operations, ensuring combat readiness.  compliance with nato standards and saabs proprietary data links enables interoperability with indian and allied systems, such as the iafs integrated air command and control system iaccs. the architecture supports future upgrades, including artificial intelligence ai-based targeting and networked warfare, aligning with the iafs vision for 2035. this adaptability makes the gripen-e an ideal platform for integrating indian missiles, particularly the astra bvraam series, which includes the astra mk-1 110 km range, mk-2 160 km, and the under-development mk-3 350 km, ramjet-powered. other potential integrations include the rudram anti-radiation missile, smart anti-airfield weapon saaw, and brahmos-ng, enhancing the jets compatibility with indias indigenous arsenal. note article cannot be reproduced without written permission of idrw.org in any form even for youtube videos to avoid copy right strikes. websites doing illegal reproductions will get dmca and legal notices.",
