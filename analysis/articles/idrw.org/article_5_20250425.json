  "content": "in any modern conflict, information dominance and situational awareness are often the deciding factors between success and failure. for the indian air force iaf, a potential future conflict with pakistan demands a strategy that goes beyond tactical airstrikes and punitive retaliation. it requires shaping the battlespace by blinding the enemy earlyspecifically by targeting critical assets such as the saab 2000 erieye airborne early warning and control system awacs operated by the pakistan air force paf. awacs aircraft like the saab 2000 erieye are strategic force multipliers, enabling long-range detection, real-time command and control, and coordinated interception operations. these platforms serve as the eyes and ears of the paf, extending radar coverage deep into indian airspace and enabling early warning of iaf fighter or missile movements. neutralizing these platformsespecially in the opening hours of a larger conflictwould severely degrade pakistans ability to mount an effective aerial defense or coordinate its fighter assets. india has recently inducted advanced long-range surface-to-air missile lrsam systems, including the barak-8er and the s-400 triumf, capable of engaging high-value airborne targets well beyond 250400 kilometers depending on the variant. these platforms offer the iaf and indian strategic command the capability to strike deep targets inside pakistans airspace or air defense bubble without crossing the international border, thereby reducing risk while maintaining escalation control. utilizing such systems to interdict high-value airborne targets like awacs or even aerial tankers and elint aircraft during heightened alert periods could lay the groundwork for a strike on an awacs platformespecially preemptivelywould be viewed as a highly escalatory act under international norms. however, in the face of credible intelligence pointing to an imminent threat, such a move can be framed as a preventive strike within the context of national defense, especially if pakistans awacs is actively tracking indian airspace or coordinating hostile activities. moreover, using surface-based air defense systems rather than manned fighter aircraft allows india to maintain strategic ambiguity, preserving a degree of plausible deniability in the early stages of engagement. the iaf must shift from a reactive to a proactive warfighting mindset. taking out deep assets like awacs isnt just about causing damageits about shaping the conditions for decisive action. in the age of network-centric warfare, the first moves must aim at decapitating the enemys ability to see, decide, and respond. note afi is a proud outsourced content creator partner of idrw.org. all content created by afi is the sole property of afi and is protected by copyright. afi takes copyright infringement seriously and will pursue all legal options available to protect its content.",
