  "content": "since the 2019 balakot airstrike, which saw indian air force iaf jets strike a jaish-e-mohammed jem terrorist camp deep inside pakistan, india has significantly bolstered its long-range missile capabilities. the induction of advanced munitions like the rudram-ii, rocks, scalp, and brahmos-a has transformed the iafs ability to conduct precision strikes deep inside pakistan without needing to approach the international border ib or line of control loc. these upgrades, driven by lessons from balakot and escalating regional tensions, enhance indias standoff strike capabilities, enabling surgical operations while minimizing risks to aircraft and personnel. the balakot airstrike on february 26, 2019, was a pivotal moment for the iaf. in response to the pulwama attack, which killed 40 crpf personnel, indian mirage 2000 jets crossed the loc to strike a jem facility in khyber-pakhtunkhwa, approximately 80 km from the border. the operation, while successful, exposed vulnerabilities pakistani air defenses responded swiftly, shooting down an iaf mig-21 and capturing its pilot the following day. the incident underscored the risks of penetrating hostile airspace and highlighted the need for standoff weapons that could strike targets from safer distances, reducing exposure to pakistans air defense systems, including the chinese-supplied hq-9 and us-supplied antpq-37 radars. since 2019, the iaf has prioritized integrating long-range missiles and glide bombs, enabling deep strikes from indian airspace or near the border. the rudram-ii, rocks, scalp, and brahmos-a, inducted or tested post-2019, are central to this strategy, offering ranges and precision that allow the iaf to target terrorist infrastructure, military installations, or strategic assets in pakistan without crossing the ib or loc. key long-range missile upgrades since 2019 rudram-ii indigenous anti-radiation and ground attack missileoverview the rudram-ii, developed by the defence research and development organisation drdo, is a supersonic air-to-surface missile designed for suppression of enemy air defenses sead and ground attack. successfully flight-tested on may 29, 2024, from a sukhoi su-30 mki off odishas coast, it builds on the rudram-i, which was tested in 2020. capabilities with a range of up to 300 km, speeds of mach 5.5, and a 200 kg payload, rudram-ii can neutralize enemy radars, communication stations, and bunkers from standoff distances. its dual-seeker system passive homing and millimeter-wave ensures high accuracy, even in adverse weather, while its lock-on-beforeafter-launch capability allows flexible targeting. strategic impact rudram-ii enables the iaf to disable pakistans air defense network, such as the ylc-18a radar, from over 100 km away, clearing the way for follow-on strikes. its integration with su-30 mki jets, with plans for rafale and tejas platforms, makes it a versatile force multiplier. for example, launched from jammu airspace, it could target let camps in muridke or bahawalpur without crossing the ib. rocks israeli air-launched ballistic missileoverview rocks, an air-launched ballistic missile albm developed by israels rafael advanced defense systems, was integrated into the iafs arsenal post-2019 as a surgical strike weapon for low-intensity conflicts. x posts indicate it has replaced older munitions like spice 2000 and popeye for primary strike roles. capabilities rocks offers a range of approximately 250 km and can carry a 500 kg warhead, delivering pinpoint accuracy against high-value targets like bunkers, airfields, or terrorist hideouts. its ballistic trajectory and high speed make it difficult to intercept, enhancing its survivability against pakistans air defenses. strategic impact deployed on su-30 mki and rafale jets, rocks allows the iaf to strike targets deep inside pakistan, such as rawalpindi or lahore, from indian airspace near punjab or jammu. its role in surgical strikes reduces the need for manned missions, as highlighted by x user syedibr47462685, who noted the risks of entering pakistani airspace post-balakot. scalp storm shadow long-range cruise missileoverview the scalp, a french-british air-launched cruise missile, was inducted with the iafs rafale jets, which joined the fleet in july 2020. it is designed for deep strikes against hardened targets and has been reserved for high-value missions. capabilities with a range of approximately 560 km and a 450 kg warhead, scalp can penetrate bunkers and command centers with precision. its low-altitude flight profile and terrain-following capability evade radar detection, making it ideal for covert strikes. integrated with rafales advanced avionics, it offers daynight, all-weather functionality. strategic impact scalp enables the iaf to target strategic assets in pakistans hinterland, such as isi facilities in islamabad or let headquarters, from standoff positions in indian airspace. its long range allows launches from central india, far from the loc, minimizing exposure to pakistans jf-17 jets or hq-9 missiles. brahmos-a air-launched supersonic cruise missileoverview the brahmos-a, an air-launched variant of the indo-russian brahmos supersonic cruise missile, was successfully tested in may 2019 and inducted into the iaf in 2020. as of july 2024, 40 su-30 mki jets have been modified to carry it, with plans to equip 84 more under the super sukhoi program. capabilities the extended-range er brahmos-a, tested in 2022 and 2023, boasts a range of 450800 km, a 300 kg warhead, and a speed of mach 3.5. its low-altitude flight as low as 5 meters and high maneuverability make it nearly uninterceptable. it can strike both land and sea targets with pinpoint accuracy, as demonstrated in tests from su-30 mki jets and naval platforms. strategic impact brahmos-a allows the iaf to strike deep inside pakistan, including targets in balochistan or karachi, from indian airspace near rajasthan or gujarat. its speed and precision make it ideal for hitting time-sensitive targets like terrorist training camps or military headquarters. x user viveksi85847001compared its potency to rudram-ii, noting its ability to deliver a similar punch against bunkers and airfields. since the 2019 balakot airstrike, the iaf has transformed its long-range strike capabilities with the induction of rudram-ii, rocks, scalp, and brahmos-a. these munitions, with ranges of 250800 km, enable precise, deep strikes into pakistan from indian airspace, reducing the risks of airspace violations and escalation. integrated with su-30 mki and rafale jets, and supported by advanced intelligence platforms, they strengthen indias counter-terrorism and deterrence posture. however, pakistans countermeasures and the risk of an arms race underscore the need for diplomatic restraint alongside military modernization. as india continues to develop hypersonic and indigenous systems, its ability to project power without crossing the ib or loc will redefine south asian security dynamics. note afi is a proud outsourced content creator partner of idrw.org. all content created by afi is the sole
